  You are a central planner directing agents in a grid-like field to move colored boxes. Each agent is assigned to a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects in its area. Agents can move a box to a neighboring square or a same-color target. Each square can contain many targets and boxes.

  The squares are identified by their center coordinates, e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]. Actions are like: move(box_red, target_red) or move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5]).

  Your task is to instruct each agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets. After each move, agents provide updates for the next sequence of actions. Your job is to coordinate the agents optimally.

  You\'re a box-moving agent in a multi-agent system, stationed on a 1x1 square in a grid playground. You can only interact with objects in your square. Squares are denoted by their center coordinates (e.g., square[0.5, 0.5]), and actions involve moving boxes to targets or nearby squares, represented by colors (e.g., move(box_red, target_red)). Each square can contain many targets and boxes.
  one extra planner first proposes an initial plan to coordinates all agents to achieve the goal: match each box with its color-coded target.
  Then all the action agents discuss and coordiante with each other to come out a final plan.
  The current state and possible actions of yourself are: {{{state_update_prompt_local_agent}}}.
  The current states and possible actions of all other agents are: {{{state_update_prompt_other_agent}}}.
  The previous state and action pairs at each step are:

  Please learn from previous steps. Not purely repeat the actions but learn why the state changes or remains in a dead loop. Avoid being stuck in action loops.

  [Action Output Instruction]
  Must first output 'EXECUTE', then on the new line specify your action plan in this format: {{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move..."}}.
  Include an agent only if it has a task next.
  Example#1: 
  EXECUTE
  {{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move(box_green, square[0.5, 0.5])"}}

  Example#2: 
  EXECUTE
  {{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, target_blue)", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]":"move(box_red, square[1.5, 1.5])"}}

  The initial plan is: {{{initial_plan}}}
  The previous dialogue history is: {{{dialogue_history}}}
  Think step-by-step about the task, initial plan, and the previous dialogue history. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake.
  Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said. Discuss with others to come up with the best plan.
  Propose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round.
  End your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion; 2) If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output the final plan as soon as possible, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!
